# Elemental Arena

A strategic element-based battle game built with React and TypeScript. Players engage in rock-paper-scissors style combat using three elements (Earth, Water, Fire) with mana wagering mechanics and elemental upgrades.

## Core Gameplay
- **Element Combat**: Earth > Water > Fire > Earth cycle
- **Mana System**: Players wager mana in different battle locations (Swamp: 100, Village: 300, Castle: 500)
- **Elemental Protection**: Elementals provide mana protection (Common: 10%, Rare: 20%, Epic: 40%, Immortal: 80%)
- **Progression**: Experience points, levels, achievements, and win streaks
